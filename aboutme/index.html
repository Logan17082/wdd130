    <p> Hi guys, nice to meet you. Let's run down the list shall we. </p>
    
     <p>I was born in Arizona but I was raised for most of my life in Montana.  Unfortunately I'm not
         from the pretty part of the state but I can whole-heartedly reccomend Glacier as a place to 
         visit.  Just do us locals a favor and don't be an idiot. The wildlife is still dangerous even
         when it walks right up to you.</p>
      <p>I've been a member of the church for all 23 years of my life.  I'm not married. I work 
        locally in Rexburg at Wendy's so if you visit often there is a pretty good chance 
        we run into eachother. </p>  
          
       <p> I think my favorite thing about BYU-I is the small class sizes. 
        I'm taking this course because a friend of mine who is a software engineer says that his greatest regret is not
        learning more about how to code stuff for the internet. I figure I'll try and learn from his
        mistake.
    </p>
